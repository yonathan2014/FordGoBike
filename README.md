# (Ford GoBike System Data Analysis)
## by (Yonathan Lesanework Ferede)

## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike Dataset was provided by Udacity for a data analysis project. It contains information information about individual rides made in a bike sharing system covering the greater san francisco bay area.

> The dataset required some wrangling to clean for some quality issues that included wrong datatypes that needed to be converted and removing null values.

> The dataset includes demographic characteristics of users, duration, information about stations (location, id, station names).


## Summary of Findings

> The distribution of the demographic characteristics of the customers shows that younger males born from the year 1998 - 1992 are the frequent users of the ride sharing service.

> Market St. at 10th St. and San Francisco Caltrain station 2 are the most frequent starting and stopping stations of the customers.

> Most users of the service are subscribers but don't use the bikeshare for all trips.

> Younger users tend to use the service for longer duration and longer trips.

> These findings will be included in the presentation.
